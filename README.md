# Equilibrium Propagation with Non-Sum-Separable Energy Consideration

This repository contains code for implementing and analyzing the Equilibrium Propagation (EqProp) algorithm with non-sum-separable energy considerations in analog neural networks. The project explores both traditional methods and a new power computation method for training neural networks on tasks such as the XOR problem.

## Repository Structure

- `eqprop_module_xor_pcm_vdm.py`: Contains necessary functions and modules for implementing the EqProp algorithm, including power dissipation calculations and voltage drop methods.
- `xor_pcm_vdm_eqprop.py`: Implements the XOR task using both the traditional EqProp method and the new power computation method. This script sets up the neural network, performs the training, and evaluates the performance.
- `starting_cond_analysis_pcm_vdm_eqprop.py`: Analyzes the starting conductance conditions for both the traditional method and the new power computation method, providing insights into the initial setup and its impact on learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
